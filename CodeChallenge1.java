//Upon creating the object of Customer, the empty constructor will call parameterized constructor and printâ€™s hi, later hello gets printed on the console.
 
1.  class Customer {
2.     Customer(){
3.     this(1);
4.     System.out.print(" hello");
5.   }

/*in the above program, there are two constructors of Class Customer, one is unparameterized and the other has
one parameter of type int.
In the above code, we are creating a customer object using the Customer() constructor.
Inside the non-parameterized constructor, there is a line of code this(1), which will call parameterized constructor inside parameterized constructor there is a print statement hi which will get printed.
Note: this keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor.
After hi, is printed the code flow will come back to the un parameterized constructor and it will print hello.
